```markdown
Learning Objectives:

1. Gain experience accessing your operating system's command line interface (CLI)
2. Gain experience working with CLI commands
3. Gain experience working with Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
4. Gain experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code

Overview: 

1. Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating
   system to create a number of folders
2. List the folders in a tree-like structure
3. Use the ping command, and practice using the break

### Technologies Used:
- Chrome
- VS Code
- Terminal


### What I Learned:
In this project I was introduced to VS Code and Terminal and learned different commands such as *tree*, *find*, and *ping*. In the second part of the project, I was able to create a JavaScript program that output to the console a string of random length between 5 - 25 characters (range inclusive) in length, that consists of all random lowercase letters from the English alphabet.
